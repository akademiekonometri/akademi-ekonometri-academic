#================= Johansen (JO) Cointegration Pairwise Tests ==================

# Notes:
#
## Function runs the Joahnsen (JO) cointegration pairwise tests.
## Johansen Cointegration test is a systematic method where direction does not matter, so the it is a symmetric test. User can use either Trace or Maximum Eigenvalue Tests (according to Lutkepohl (2000), Trace test has more power in small samples hence preferred). Only constant is added to model as deafult.
## In cointegration test the transitory form of VECM is used as default and can only be change in function source code.
## Function requires a time series (ts) object, either bivariate or multivariate.
## Lag length is selected with Lag argument by AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) as default since Kilian (2001) stated that even in finite-order VAR models in many cases of practical interest the AIC is likely to be preferable to the BIC or HQ because MSE is lower and impulse response confidence intervals are more accurate then others. Lag length is determined in VARselect function from vars package by using several different information criteria. User can select on of the followings for lag selection: AIC, BIC, HQ (Hannan and Quinn Information Criterion) and FPE (Final Prediction Error). Note that as default in VARselect function lag.max is defined as lag.short = trunc((4 * (length(ts) / 100)^0.25)).
## The default for Deterministic is "Constant" which adds only intercept to 1st regression. User can also select "None" and "Trend". Using Deterministic = "Trend" adds only trend the regression.
## The default for Type is Trace which is suggested by LÃ¼tkepohl (2000) to have more power in small sample sizes. User can also select Eigen for JO test.
## The default for Season argument is NULL which does not add any seasonal dummies in Johansen cointegration tests and does not use seasonal dummies in Johansen test lag procedure. If Season is TRUE, then the frequency of the input time series object will be used in lag selection and in Johansen cointegration test.
## The default for LaTeX is FALSE which produces output only for printing.
## All the test results will be on the upper triangle of the output table. The diagonal of the table will be empty.
## The outputs of the function is named as "jo.coint.pairwise.results" data frames.

# Usage:
#
# JO.Coint.Pairwise.Test(Data, Lag = "AIC", Deterministic = "Constant", Type = "Trace", Season = NULL, LaTeX = FALSE)

#
## Data: Time series (ts) object. It can be bivariate or multivariate. Cannot be univariate.
## Lag: Character. Lag length selection in JO tests. Options are AIC, BIC, HQ, and FPE.
## Deterministic: Character. Deterministic parts for the cointegration relationship. Options are None, Constant, Trend.
## Type: Type of the Johansen cointegration test. Options are Trace and Eigen.
## Season: Logical. Add seasonal dummies in Johansen test lag selection procedure and in cointegration regression.
## LaTeX: Logical. Output is corrected for LaTeX.
## To run the function without any argument matching problem, make sure to specify all arguments with their names always (if non-default values are selected).

# Examples:
#
## JO.Coint.Pairwise.Test(Data = data.ts)
## JO.Coint.Pairwise.Test(Data = data.ts, Lag = "BIC", Deterministic = "Trend", Type = "Eigen", LaTeX = TRUE)
## JO.Coint.Pairwise.Test(Data = data.ts, Lag = "HQ", Deterministic = "None", Type = "Eigen", LaTeX = TRUE)
